## [Unreleased] — Digital Painting fork

### Added

- Add an isolated digital-painting extension in `src/tools/painting-tools.ts`, integrated into the upstream server with only one import and one tool-registration call.
- Add `photoshop_list_brush_presets` with optional case-insensitive filtering and result limiting.
- Add `photoshop_select_brush_preset` for exact-name selection of installed Photoshop brush presets.
- Add `photoshop_get_brush_settings` and `photoshop_set_brush` for size, hardness, opacity, flow, spacing, angle, roundness, tip flips, pressure overrides, airbrush, and smoothing.
- Add `photoshop_set_foreground_color` for painting color control.
- Add `photoshop_sample_color` for pinned composite point sampling and optional local-average sampling via a temporary merged duplicate; returns RGB/8-bit RGB/HEX without modifying the source document or its Color Sampler markers.
- Add `photoshop_paint_strokes` for batched Brush/Pencil/Eraser/Smudge strokes, Bezier handles, closed paths, and Photoshop `simulatePressure`.
- Add per-stroke `color`, `size`, `opacity`, and `flow` overrides to `photoshop_paint_strokes`.
- Add interpolated `dynamics` profiles to `photoshop_paint_strokes` for size/opacity/flow changes along open strokes, with linear/ease-in/ease-out/ease-in-out interpolation and automatic segment-count selection.
- Add `AUTO`/`SINGLE_HISTORY` paint batching modes. `AUTO` proactively chunks expensive mixed batches before they hit the ExtendScript timeout; `SINGLE_HISTORY` keeps the legacy one-history-step behavior when that tradeoff is explicitly preferred.
- Allow one-point strokes as brush dabs/stamps; internally they are converted to a zero-length path stroke.
- Add `scripts/test-painting-tools.mjs` for live Photoshop validation.
- Add offline and live paint batching/dynamics regressions in `scripts/test-painting-batching.mjs` and `scripts/test-painting-batching-live.mjs`.
- Add `docs/digital-painting.md` for painting architecture and API documentation.
- Add `docs/digital-painting-agent-skill.md` and MCP guide prompt `ps.digital_painting_control` for iterative visual control, semantic passes, occlusion-aware drawing, cleanup, and state-based completion.
- Add `photoshop_measure_points`, `photoshop_add_guides`, `photoshop_list_guides`, and `photoshop_clear_guides` for explicit reference/proportion measurement and Photoshop guide control.
- Add `photoshop_transform_landmarks` and `photoshop_compare_landmarks` for reusable semantic-frame landmark transfer and normalized reference-vs-candidate error reporting without automatic landmark detection.
- Add `scripts/test-measurement-tools.mjs` for live measurement/guide smoke testing.
- Add `scripts/test-landmark-ergonomics.mjs` for Photoshop-independent landmark transform/compare regression coverage.
- Add offline and two-document live regressions for document targeting in `scripts/test-document-targeting.mjs` and `scripts/test-document-targeting-live.mjs`.
- Add offline and live color-sampling regressions in `scripts/test-color-sampling.mjs` and `scripts/test-color-sampling-live.mjs`.

### Changed

- Brush-setting updates now preserve the full active Photoshop Brush Tool descriptor and modify only requested fields, avoiding accidental loss of complex preset dynamics/settings.
- Painting batches cache the active Brush Tool descriptors and avoid redundant descriptor reads/writes for unchanged per-stroke overrides.
- Painting completion guidance now treats stroke counts as soft planning budgets by default; visual Definition of Done is the normal stopping criterion unless the user explicitly requests a hard cap.
- Painting-skill evaluation now has a fresh-composition rule: prior demo coordinates, stroke lists, object proportions and precomputed object-specific occlusion geometry must not be reused unless the user explicitly asks for a variation/refinement.
- Add release-oriented installation documentation for clean GitHub clone/ZIP installs, Chat On Steroids Core/direct-stdio and generic MCP host configuration, verification, updating, and a release checklist.
- Standardize the Chat On Steroids Photoshop path on Core + direct stdio; the shared Plugins connector is no longer used for Photoshop execution, health checks, or fallback diagnostics.
- Painting guidance now supports explicit measurement checkpoints for portraits, architecture, perspective, and other proportion-sensitive work; supplied landmark coordinates remain visually chosen rather than automatically detected.
- Photoshop/COS execution is now sticky in the digital-painting control contract: short continuation turns cannot silently reroute an established Photoshop workflow to external image generation.
- Harden optional `document_id` targeting across document-bound tools: ids must be positive integers, unknown ids fail closed, successful pinned calls expose `document_target`, and the UXP neural-filter lane both pre-activates the requested document and re-selects that id inside the same `batchPlay` request. ExtendScript tools retain the stronger same-script document guard immediately before the operation.
- Separate fork identity from upstream branding/distribution across README, translated docs, package/server/MCPB metadata, client examples, web/site surfaces, and release tooling. The fork is source-distributed from `lavalava45/photoshop-mcp-digital-painting`; upstream `photoshop-mcp.com`, `@alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp`, and `io.github.alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp` are now explicitly labeled as upstream-only rather than fork distribution channels.
- Disable inherited upstream analytics by default in the fork by removing the embedded upstream Rybbit site id; analytics now require an explicit fork-owned `RYBBIT_SITE_ID` configuration.

### Validation

- Live-tested on Photoshop 2026 for Windows.
- Enumerated 123 installed brush presets through Photoshop `presetManager` during the 2026-09-14 test.
- Verified exact selection of `Hard Round Pressure Size`.
- Verified write/readback of pressure-size, pressure-opacity, airbrush, and smoothing settings.
- Verified batched straight, pressure-simulated, and Bezier strokes.
- Verified textured `Square Charcoal` painting and pressure tapering.
- Verified per-stroke color/size/opacity/flow overrides and one-point dabs.
- Validated the painting primitives with iterative artistic tests in Photoshop.
- Mixer Brush path stroking is not yet considered supported: a direct Action Manager `stroke` attempt using `wetBrushTool` returned an invalid-parameters Photoshop error.
- Verified a 24-stroke heterogeneous pass through `AUTO` batching (6 internal batches) and a 32-segment Bezier taper through dynamics (8 internal batches) on Photoshop 2026 without per-script timeout.
- Verified RGB per-stroke overrides remain intact while descriptor caching is active.
- Verified document targeting with two simultaneously open temporary documents: while document B was active, pinned layer creation and guide mutation affected only document A, and pinned close closed A while leaving B open (`DOCUMENT_TARGETING_LIVE_TEST_OK`).
- Verified `photoshop_sample_color` on Photoshop 2026 with two temporary documents: pinned point samples returned the intended document's composite color, radius-based Average sampling returned the same known uniform color, source documents were unchanged, and out-of-bounds coordinates failed closed (`COLOR_SAMPLING_LIVE_TEST_OK`).
- `npm run build:server` and `npm run lint` pass for the current painting branch.

### Pending

- Investigate richer pressure representation beyond Photoshop's binary `simulatePressure` flag.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-09-09

[v1.7.5...HEAD](https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp/compare/v1.7.5...HEAD)

### Changed

- Update anonymous usage analytics for the MCP server, standalone UI, and marketing site ([#36](https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp/pull/36)).

## [1.7.5] - 2026-09-07

[v1.7.4...v1.7.5](https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp/compare/v1.7.4...v1.7.5)

### Fixes

- Map `photoshop_set_layer_blend_mode` `COLOR` to ExtendScript `BlendMode.COLORBLEND`; Darker/Lighter Color fall back to Action Manager ([#29](https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp/issues/29)).
- Fix `photoshop_apply_layer_style` drop shadow (and other styles) `putObject` class-id argument; Use Global Light is off so `angle` applies.
- Treat `photoshop_place_image` `x`/`y` as absolute canvas top-left, not an offset from centered Place.
- `photoshop_recipe_remove_background` falls back to Color Range on uniform/high-key studio backgrounds (`details.method`).
- Optional `document_id` on mutating tools pins edits to a document from `get_state` / `list_documents`; `document.id` is included in context.
- Drop shadow no longer sets a locale-specific "Linear" contour name; Color Range fallback writes both Lab min and max; `place_image` fails instead of silently skipping translate.
- Wrap generative `prompt` values in ExtendScript string literals (`jsStringLiteral`); non-ASCII is `\uXXXX`-escaped so multi-word prompts no longer break JSX syntax ([#31](https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp/issues/31)).
- Apply the detected Photoshop app name on macOS before the first ExtendScript run ([#32](https://github.com/alisaitteke/photoshop-mcp/pull/32)).
